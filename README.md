# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

#### Ege Ã–zkan - eambertide

Hi there, this is my GitHub repository where I keep my open source projects and occasional tinkering, most of these repos are normal programming stuff, occasionaly my more artisty site may step in and add something more uniuqe! Let me take you a curated tour of my projects now!

## My Projects!

### Things I am Espacially Proud of ðŸŒ 

I have a lot of projects in my GitHub, at the time of my writing around twenty public and around fourty private, and that is not counting the ones in organisations, teams I founded with my friends. But, since this should be like a CV of sorts, I wanted to sort some of the ones I am most proud of:

#### [Changeling: the Social Deception Game](#)

Built on top of SocketIO, Flask, ReactJS and Redis, Changeling is a game to be played with friends, where you dabble in secrets, reveal your life, and learn about others. Played with the right soul, a group of players may leave the night feeling closer as friends. Changeling is designed to have a minimalist interface while still retaining a mood of introuge and horror, when a group of friends enter the woods, they realise one of them has been replaced by a fae...

#### [Trefusis Engine](https://github.com/ProjectAras/TrefusisEngine)

Trefusis Engine is a work in progress 2D game engine made for top down and isometric games build with SDL and C++, that has Python scripting support. Although the project was paused after school meant we couldn't allocate time, the TrefusisEngine is a working small engine, able to generate maps from given tilemaps and configuration files, handle character movement, weather and seasons.

#### [Datalite](https://github.com/ambertide/datalite)

Datalite is a Python library written for the modern language, extending `dataclasses` a Python 3.7+ feature that is similar to C structs, to automatically bind to an SQLite3 database file with automatic schema creation, (with some caveats, such as not supporting automatic foreign key resolution), Datalite is perfect for embeded and scientific applications, it is published on PyPI and can be installed via `pip` easily.

#### [Voynich Explorer](https://github.com/ambertide/VoynichExplorer)

A *completely* static website to explore the mysterious Voynich manuscript written in an alphabet no one knows, eluding best of our experts so far, created by parsing through the transcript, writing a custom (simple) static templating engine, writing the frontend using MiniCSS and vanilla JS, webscrapping the WikimediaCommons page for the images of the manuscript pages, signing up to defunct mailing lists and tracking down a font through Reddit and putting them all together. An experiment to learn how many HTML files are one too many, result? However much you like!

#### [SASVM](https://github.com/ambertide/SASVM)

Spacecat Assembly Simulator is an educational tool to teach first-timers about Assembly, I wrote it when I realise the original program we used in my university was getting too old to work properly, this one fully supports the files of the older program. Language itself is a simplified assembly language for an 8-bit machine that never was.

##### Web Programming ðŸ”—

I have knowledge of ReactJS on the frontend and Flask in the backend, although I have used Django in the past, alongside with the usual suspects HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and have worked on both dynamic and static websites, I have written small custom static website generators but also worked with Hugo and Jekyll. Of course, I have had my fair share of encounters with Bootstrap framework, alongside with MiniCSS.

##### Game Development 


##### Web Scrapping and API Wrapping ðŸ¤–

I know my way around BeautifulSoup and HTML web scrapping, and know how to write wrapper APIs for high-level languages around web APIs, including SOAP APIs.
