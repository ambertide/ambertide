Hi there, this is my GitHub repository where I keep my open source projects and occasional tinkering, most of these repos are normal programming stuff, occasionaly my more artisty site may step in and add something more uniuqe! Let me take you a curated tour of my projects now!

## My Projects!

### Things I am Espacially Proud of ðŸŒ 

I have a lot of projects in my GitHub, at the time of my writing around twenty public and around fourty private, and that is not counting the ones in organisations, teams I founded with my friends. But, since this should be like a CV of sorts, I wanted to sort some of the ones I am most proud of:

#### [Datalite](https://github.com/ambertide/datalite)

Datalite is a Python library written for the modern language, extending `dataclasses` a Python 3.7+ feature that is similar to C structs, to automatically bind to an SQLite3 database file with automatic schema creation, (with some caveats, such as not supporting automatic foreign key resolution), Datalite is perfect for embeded and scientific applications, it is published on PyPI and can be installed via `pip` easily.

#### [Voynich Explorer](https://github.com/ambertide/VoynichExplorer)

A *completely* static website to explore the mysterious Voynich manuscript written in an alphabet no one knows, eluding best of our experts so far, created by parsing through the transcript, writing a custom (simple) static templating engine, writing the frontend using MiniCSS and vanilla JS, webscrapping the WikimediaCommons page for the images of the manuscript pages, signing up to defunct mailing lists and tracking down a font through Reddit and putting them all together. An experiment to learn how many HTML files are one too many, result? However much you like!

#### [Florence Engine](https://github.com/ADA86Games/Florence)

A text-based adventure game engine targeting x86 MS-DOS computers, but to be programmed in modern environments targeted for Retro game programming.

#### [Jotform Polls Teams App](https://github.com/ambertide/JotFormTeamsApp)

Jotform Teams is a Microsoft Teams App that can be used to connect to one's Jotform account, create a poll and share it with users. Created during my internship at Jotform.

#### [Changeling: the Social Deception Game](https://github.com/ambertide/Changeling)

Built on top of SocketIO, Flask, ReactJS and Redis, Changeling is a game to be played with friends, where you dabble in secrets, reveal your life, and learn about others. Played with the right soul, a group of players may leave the night feeling closer as friends. Changeling is designed to have a minimalist interface while still retaining a mood of introuge and horror, when a group of friends enter the woods, they realise one of them has been replaced by a fae...




### There is more! ðŸ™Œ

Above are the projects that are mostly completed, they may have more to be added, but there are many more I have done over the years, some of which are finished but I just didn't feel like they deserved to be at the top the page; others, currently paused but I may return to them any moment, and finally some others are a bit too old or too niche to be up there.

* [Web Programming](#web-programming-)
* [Game Development](#game-development-)
* [Programming Languages](#programming-languages-)
* [Web Scrapping & APIs](#web-scrapping-and-api-wrapping-)
* [Narratives](#narrative-driven-experiences-)

##### Web Programming ðŸ”—

I have knowledge of ReactJS on the frontend and Flask in the backend, although I have used Django in the past, alongside with the usual suspects HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and have worked on both dynamic and static websites, I have written small custom static website generators but also worked with Hugo and Jekyll. Of course, I have had my fair share of encounters with Bootstrap framework, alongside with MiniCSS.

##### Game Development ðŸŽ®

I have interest in Game Development, espacially narrative-driven games, over the years I have experimented with many technologies, have written my small engine (not completed) in C++ with SDL by collabrating with a friend, wrote an Amnesia custom story with another, have written numerous Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style interactive web games with Inkle, even published some in Google Play once (they aren't there anymore, though.)

###### Game Development, but Retro ðŸ‘¾

Last year I realised I *really* love Retro Games, this resulted in a series of prototypes and tools to facilitate DOS x86 Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style game development. This led to me actually learning parts of x86 assembly as well as some DOS Interrupts and system calls. I created the following:

##### Programming Languages ðŸ”¨

I am a huge Programming Language nerd! Proud subscriber to r/ProgrammingLanguages, design and implementation of programming languages has always interested me, I have written small interpreters here and there and have penned a proposal for a new programming language, I even implemented parts of it. (CFluxion remains incomplete)

##### Web Scrapping and API Wrapping ðŸ¤–

I know my way around BeautifulSoup and HTML web scrapping, and know how to write wrapper APIs for high-level languages around web APIs, including SOAP APIs.

##### Narrative-Driven Experiences ðŸ“–

I always liked writing, hence, sometimes I tend to combine my experiences in writing with my programming experience to create unique narratives, websites, alternate reality games, these are listed here.
